    JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used to 
build web applications. It is not limited to the web; it can also be 
used for the backend development with technologies like Node.js.

    It is open source and has a huge community support, which means
there are plenty of resources and support available for learning. It uses 
a syntax like other programming languages and easy to learn.
